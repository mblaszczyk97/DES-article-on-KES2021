Dynamic Ensemble Selection article on KES2021

Classifying imbalanced data remains a challenging task. The paper presents a framework for imbalanced datasets classification
which makes use of different methods of oversampling and methods of dynamical selection of classifiers. The framework allows
to perform extensive experiments to determine best possible configuration for the examined dataset in terms of geometric mean
metric (g-mean). The results on benchmark datasets are presented.
